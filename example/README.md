# style-queries-example

An example React Native app using `react-native-style-queries`.

This example is implemented with [Expo](https://expo.dev) so you don't need native development tools to try it out.

Note that the example currently installs the version of `react-native-style-queries` published to the npm registry. We haven't yet gotten the example to pull in the local version of the libraries. If you'd like to try out in-progress changes to the library, consider using [`yalc`](https://github.com/wclr/yalc) to publish the changes locally.

## Requirements

- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)

## Installation

```bash
$ yarn install
```

## Running

```bash
$ yarn start
```

Then click "iOS", "Android", or "Web"
